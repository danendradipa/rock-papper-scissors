# Rock Paper Scissors Classification

This project focuses on classifying hand gestures into rock, paper, or scissors using a neural network built with TensorFlow. The goal is to develop a program that can accurately recognize these hand shapes.

## Project Description

- **Objective**: Classify images of hand gestures (rock, paper, scissors) using a neural network.
- **Framework**: TensorFlow
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
